# 2. Sum of digits

Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.











# 3. Write a Python program that receives a student's grade as input. 

If the grade is greater than or equal to 90, output “A” (excellent)
If the grade is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, output “B” (good)
If the grade is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, “C” is output (moderate).

If the grade is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70, output “B” (bad)
If the grade is less than 60 , “F” is output (poor).
